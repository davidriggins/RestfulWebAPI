Create Project
	Select to create a new project.
	Select ASP.NET Core Web API
	Project Name: MagicVilla_VillaAPI
	Solution Name: MagicVilla
	=>Next
	Select .NET 7
	=>Create

	Delete the WeatherForecast.cs and WeatherForecastController.cs files

	Add a new class called VillaAPIController.cs in the Controllers folder
	Have it derive from : ControllerBase
		- If it were to derive from Controller, it would put in overhead for Views
	Add [ApiController] attribrute to class.
	
	Create a new folder called Models
	Add a new class called "Villa" to the Models folder.
		public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
	
	Create the following endpoint in the API Controller:
		public IEnumerable<Villa> GetVillas()
        {
            return new List<Villa>
            {
                new Villa {Id=1,Name="Pool View"},
                new Villa {Id=2,Name="Beach View"}
            };
        }
		
	Create a route for the endpoint by adding [Route("api/VillaAPI")] attribute.
	Create the action attribute [HttpGet] for the endpoint.
	
	You can automatically use the controller name in the routing endpoint:
		[Route("api/[controller]")] // Does not reccommend though
